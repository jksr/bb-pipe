all the structure pipe checked, everything should be fine.

For the odds, my method still gives different results than meishan's, and her results work better
for registration prediction. there could be something wrong with get_pair script, or with
pair-odds calculation script.
This needs to be checked later.

For several proteins (eg. 4k3b & 4c4v) the script may fail because of the incorrect strand detection
This can be easily fixed by:
	run pipe till strand detection step
	manually open the wrong .strands & .tmstrands files and correct them
	run subscripts after strand detection step
